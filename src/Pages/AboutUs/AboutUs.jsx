      {/* COMPANY STORY */}
      <section className="about-section story-section">
  <h2>Our Journey Began With A Dream - The Story of STARRY NIGHTS INDIA</h2>

  <q>
    STARRY NIGHTS INDIA was founded in September 2017 with a bold vision - to redefine the way India 
    experiences travel. While many travel agencies focused only on selling fixed tour packages and 
    discount-based deals, we believed travel should be emotional, immersive, and transformational. 
    Our mission from day one was clear: create personalized travel experiences that feel premium, safe, 
    and unforgettable.
  </q>

  <q>
    The journey began as a passionate trekking and adventure travel community in Maharashtra. 
    Weekend treks, night camping experiences, mountain expeditions, and raw nature escapes formed 
    the foundation of what STARRY NIGHTS INDIA stands for today - adventure tourism with safety, 
    professionalism, and emotional connection. Under open skies and around campfires, strangers 
    became friends, and a travel community was born.
  </q>

  <q>
    As trust grew, so did our vision. What started with trekking expeditions expanded into 
    structured domestic tour packages across India, student educational tours, corporate travel programs, 
    group departures, customized honeymoon packages, family vacation planning, and curated 
    international holiday packages. Every new service was added with one goal - deliver seamless 
    travel management backed by expert planning and verified partners.
  </q>

  <q>
    STARRY NIGHTS INDIA gradually evolved into a premium experiential travel company offering 
    complete travel solutions including hotel bookings, transport arrangements, visa assistance, 
    luxury honeymoon planning, corporate offsite coordination, and personalized international tours. 
    Our approach has always been detail-oriented, transparent, and traveler-first.
  </q>

  <q>
    Today, STARRY NIGHTS INDIA is recognized as a trusted travel brand serving families, couples, 
    students, corporates, and adventure enthusiasts. We do not simply sell travel packages - 
    we design meaningful journeys that inspire growth, strengthen relationships, and create 
    lifelong memories. Each itinerary carries our signature blend of strategic planning, 
    premium hospitality, safety standards, and emotional storytelling.
  </q>

  <q>
    Our journey continues with one powerful promise - every traveler who chooses STARRY NIGHTS INDIA 
    returns home not just with photographs, but with stories, friendships, personal growth, and 
    unforgettable experiences. We aim to build a global travel community rooted in responsible tourism, 
    cultural respect, sustainable travel practices, and world-class service excellence.
  </q>

  <q>
    STARRY NIGHTS INDIA is more than a travel company - it is a movement of explorers who believe 
    travel should transform perspectives, create purpose, and connect people beyond borders. 
    And this journey is only just beginning.
